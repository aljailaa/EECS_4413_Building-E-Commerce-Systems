# Executive Summary
In this project we take the first step in our view migration journey by creating a webapp whose views are generated via JSP. 
The project will expose the key elements of JSP and leverage advanced features in Tomcat such as persistence scopes, 
filters for ad-hoc changes, and listeners for analytics. The project will also expose some of the Map APIs in Google's cloud platform.
