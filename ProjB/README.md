# Executive Summary
You will create a server-side application that provides 7 web services. 
The services were designed to expose various aspects of web development, such as form handling, TCP connections,
 database lookups, HTTP connections, json/xml to html transformation, and open authentication. 
 We will use an agile methodology; adhere to best-practice design patterns such as MVC; and leverage the Tomcat server to host our logic.
# The First Release
You will be guided toward the 0.1 Release through step-by-step instructions. Follow them carefully and don't proceed to the next instruction until you complete the one before it. 
If you get stuck in one step, post a question on the forum. Note that these instructions assume that you are working within the Virtual Box on your own machine or on a loaner laptop that you borrowed from the Prism monitor. 
If you want to work on a lab workstation, you first need to set it up using the instructions in this document (this needs to be done just once).
